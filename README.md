This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Groovy related to method overloading and null handling.  The `foo` method exhibits unexpected behavior when both input arguments are null. The issue arises from the implicit type coercion and how Groovy handles null values in comparisons and arithmetic operations. The solution provides a more robust approach that explicitly handles the null cases.
